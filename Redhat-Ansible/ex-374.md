### 1. How can I write an Ansible playbook with two tasks — one tagged __alpha__ that deploys the content _Que Sera, Sera_ to /var/www/html/index.html, and another tagged __beta__ that deploys the content _whatever be, will be_ to the same path — such that when the playbook is run without either of these tags, no file is created or modified?

        - name: Tagged task execution
          hosts: web
          become: true
          tasks :
            - name: Copy Que Sera to index.html
              tags:
                - alpha
                - never
              ansible.builtin. copy:
                content: "Que Sera, Sera"
                dest: /var/www/html/index.html
            - name: Copy Whatever be will be to index.html
              tags :
                - never
                - beta
              ansible.builtin. copy:
                content: "Whatever be will be"
                dest: /var/www/html/index.html

### 2. How can I write an Ansible playbook with a that copies __alias.conf__ to /var/www/, and only restarts the web server if the file was actually copied (i.e., changed)? If the file already exists with the same content, it should not be copied again, and the web server should not be restarted. __alias.conf__ will be given.

          - name: Handler usage
            hosts: all
            tasks:
              - name: copy alias. conf
                ansible.builtin. copy:
                  src: alias.conf
                  dest: /var/www
                notify: Restart httpd
            handlers :
              - name: Restart httpd
                ansible.builtin. service:
                  name: httpd
                  state: restarted

### 3. How can I install the Ansible collection newsrander.collection_demo into a custom path /home/admin/mycollections instead of the default location?

        [galaxy]
        server_list = published_repo

        [galaxy_server. published_repo]
        url=https://hub.lab.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/
        token=7c97eb89clbdae98d04856c6861203eb1cd61ca2
        [galaxy_server.galaxy]
        url=https://galaxy.ansible.com

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32904818-0824-42c9-bda1-e980d91fd6cd)


        ansible-galaxy collection install newsrander.collection_demo -p /home/admin/mycollections/


### 4. How can I create a custom Ansible collection named rhel.user that contains a role called newuser, where the role includes a main.yml file in the tasks directory and a user.conf file in the files directory. The main.yml will be given and you need to copy it to the tasks folder.

        $ ansible-galaxy collection init rhel.user
         - Collection rhel. user was created successfully
        $ ansible-galaxy role init newuser
         - Role newuser was created successfully
        $ mkdir meta
        $ vi meta/runtime.yml
        $ ansible-galaxy collection build
        Created collection for rhel.user at /home/student/qn4/rhel/user/rhel-user-1.0.0.tar.gz
        $ cp rhel-user-1.0.0.tar.gz .. / .. /
        
#### In ansible.cfg

        [galaxy_server. inbound-rhel]
        url=https://hub.lab.example.com/api/galaxy/content/inbound-rhel/
        token=64c0181d4432a7fe1955d60467adfale820a8160

        $ ansible-galaxy collection publish rhel-user-1.0.0.tar.gz
        Collection has been published to the Galaxy server published_repo https://hub.lab.example.com/api/galaxy/content published/
        Waiting until Galaxy import task https://hub.lab.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/v3/imports/collections/f62c710b-aed5-4f6f-84d3-cd1f4a327b37/ has completed
        [ERROR]: Galaxy import error message: CHANGELOG. rst file not found at top level of collection.

### 5. Create a custom execution environment named ee-user-supported:2.2 using ee-supported-rhel8:latest as the base image and ansible-builder-rhel8:latest as the builder image, and include the custom collection rhel.user in the environment?

### 6. Create a custom environment. same base and builder image as the above question. The custom environment should have python dependencies python 3.6 packages - python36 and python3-ldap

### 7. Write a playbook which depends on collection __rhel.user__. When executed it uses __newuser__ role to create users.

                ---
                - name: Usage of collection
                  hosts: all
                  collections:
                    - rhel.user

### 8. Write a main.sh script to run an Ansible playbook named main.yml using an inventory file ldap-inventory.pw, where the playbook deploys content to /etc/motd and /etc/issue.d/banner on web hosts, and is executed inside a custom execution environment that includes Python 3.6, the python3-ldap package, and Python 3.6 modules?

### 9. Create users in Ansible where the username is given by name, each user is assigned a randomly generated password and saved to a file named password-<username> (e.g., password-frederick), with the password file stored in the same directory as the playbook. The password for each user is the hashed value of the password file. The GECOS field for each user is in the format "First Middle Last". users_imformation.yml has the details on the users.
