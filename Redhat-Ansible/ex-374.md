### 1. How can I write an Ansible playbook with two tasks — one tagged alpha that deploys the content Que Sera, Sera to /var/www/html/index.html, and another tagged beta that deploys the content whatever be, will be to the same path — such that when the playbook is run without either of these tags, no file is created or modified?

### 2. How can I write an Ansible playbook with a that copies alias.conf to /var/www/, and only restarts the web server if the file was actually copied (i.e., changed)? If the file already exists with the same content, it should not be copied again, and the web server should not be restarted.

### 3. How can I install the Ansible collection newsrander.collection_demo into a custom path /home/admin/mycollections instead of the default location?

### 4. How can I create a custom Ansible collection named rhel.user that contains a role called newuser, where the role includes a main.yml file in the tasks directory and a user.conf file in the files directory. The main.yml will be given and you need to copy it to the tasks folder.

### 5. Create a custom execution environment named ee-user-supported:2.2 using ee-supported-rhel8:latest as the base image and ansible-builder-rhel8:latest as the builder image, and include the custom collection rhel.user in the environment?

### 6. Create a custom environment. same base and builder image as the above question. The custom environment should have python dependencies python 3.6 packages - python36 and python3-ldap

### 7. Write a playbook which depends on collection __rhel.user__. When executed it uses __newuser__ role to create users.

### 8. Write a main.sh script to run an Ansible playbook named main.yml using an inventory file ldap-inventory.pw, where the playbook deploys content to /etc/motd and /etc/issue.d/banner on web hosts, and is executed inside a custom execution environment that includes Python 3.6, the python3-ldap package, and Python 3.6 modules?

### 9. Create users in Ansible where the username is given by name, each user is assigned a randomly generated password and saved to a file named password-<username> (e.g., password-frederick), with the password file stored in the same directory as the playbook. The password for each user is the hashed value of the password file. The GECOS field for each user is in the format "First Middle Last". users_imformation.yml has the details on the users.
